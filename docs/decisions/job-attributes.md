# Job listing

## Problem

All job ads must be homogenous and standard. For that we must decide in beforehand on all fields/attributes of a job ad, so that even if various people at various points in time create a job ad, the ads will always be similar in structure..

## Decision

These are the attributes a job ad on the website must have.

* introduction
* role description
* required skills and experience
* location
* pay and benefits
* how to apply
